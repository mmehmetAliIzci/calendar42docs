##Learning path

1. We recommend you to see [The Big Picture](#the-big-picture) before starting anything. You can see how our system operates. Also to not get confused in calling API endpoints, its good to learn the what is a [rideshare](#rideshare), [travel-intent-pattern](#travel-intent-pattern) and [travel-intent](#travel-intent).

2. [Walkthrough](#walkthrough) is the 'Hello World' of our system. You can grasp more deeply the  concept with the help of the responses and queries. It briefly shows the use case of our system.

3. You can find all end-points, parameters, filters and possible responses in `API` section.
