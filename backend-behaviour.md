* Driver can only pick one passenger.
* There is no drop-off location. Passenger and driver must go to the same place.
* Our endpoints is not named in usual way eg. /api/travel-intent-pattern/v1/travel-intent-pattern/
* Don't use same value for  `driver_id` & `passenger_id` wwhen filtering rideshare: `rideshare/v1/rideshare/?driver_id=samething&passenger_id=samething` wont work
